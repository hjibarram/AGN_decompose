# AGN_decompose v2.1.0.dev üöÄ

2D AGN‚ÄëHost decomposition via bidimensional photometric decomposition.

---

## üìñ Description

AGN_decompose is a Python-based tool designed for the two-dimensional decomposition of integral field spectroscopic (IFU) images of galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN). It uses an iterative method to separate the nuclear AGN emission from the host galaxy, yielding clean spectra and spatial maps of both components ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-pdf/536/1/752/61021285/stae2623.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

This tool is ideal for analyzing astronomical data and studying AGN properties without contamination from the surrounding galaxy.

### Documentation: Writing External Functions for AGN Decomposition

This guide explains how to create and use custom external functions in the `AGNdecomp` pipeline for modeling the light distribution of AGN and host galaxies. It covers the expected function structure, required parameters, and example models including **Moffat** and **Gaussian** profiles.

---

#### üß© Purpose of External Functions

External functions allow users to define their own models for point spread functions (PSF) or galaxy light profiles. These models can be used in place of or in addition to built-in profiles, providing flexibility for special cases or new scientific requirements.

---

#### üìÅ File Format and Structure

Create a `.py` file with the following requirements:

- Must contain at least one main function that returns a model array.
- Optionally, include a second function to return derived values such as PSF FWHM or total flux.
- Must be importable from the location specified in your `config_file.yaml`.
- It requires the prior definitions in `priors_prop.yaml` to set initial guesses and bounds for the parameters.

#### Required Imports

```python
import numpy as np
import AGNdecomp.tools.tools as tol  # for elliptical radius calculations
```

---

#### üîß Example 1: Full Moffat Profile plus Sersic

```python
def ExternFunctionName(pars, x_t=0, y_t=0):
    At=pars['At']
    ds=pars['alpha']
    be=pars['beta']
    dx=pars['xo']
    dy=pars['yo']
    Io=pars['Io']
    bn=pars['bn']
    Re=pars['Re']
    ns=pars['ns']
    es=pars['ellip']
    th=pars['theta']
    r1=tol.radi_ellip(x_t-dx,y_t-dy,es,th)
    model = At * (1.0 + (r1**2.0 / ds**2.0))**(-be)
    model = Io * np.exp(-bn*((r1/Re)**(1./ns) -1.0)) + model
    return model
```

#### Required: PSF total Flux & FWHM Functions

```python
def ExternFunctionName_flux_psf(pars, x_t=0, y_t=0):
    psf = pars['alpha'] * 2.0 * np.sqrt(2.0**(1.0 / pars['beta']) - 1)
    flux = np.pi * pars['alpha']**2.0 * pars['At'] / (pars['beta'] - 1.0)
    return psf, flux
```

---

#### üîß Example 2: Gaussian Profile

```python
def GaussianModel(pars, x_t=0, y_t=0):
    A = pars['At']
    sigma = pars['sigma']
    xo = pars['xo']
    yo = pars['yo']
    ellip = pars['ellip']
    theta = pars['theta']

    r = tol.radi_ellip(x_t - xo, y_t - yo, ellip, theta)
    model = A * np.exp(-0.5 * (r / sigma)**2)
    return model

def GaussianModel_flux_psf(pars, x_t=0, y_t=0):
    sigma = pars['sigma']
    A = pars['At']
    fwhm = 2.3548 * sigma
    flux = 2 * np.pi * sigma**2 * A
    return fwhm, flux
```

---

#### üîÑ Integration Steps

1. Define your external model in a `.py` file.
2. Update your `config_file.yaml`:

```yaml
ext_name: GaussianModel
ext_file: extern_function_example.py
ext_path: path/to/your/file/
```

3. Ensure the file is placed in the directory specified in `ext_path`.
4. Define the priors for your model in `priors_prop.yaml`.

---

#### üìå Parameters

Your external function will receive:

- `pars`: Dictionary containing model parameters as defined in `priors_prop.yaml`.
- `x_t`, `y_t`: 2D arrays (meshgrids) representing spatial pixel coordinates.

Use `tol.radi_ellip(x, y, e, theta)` to compute elliptical distances for modeling elliptical shapes.

---

#### üìö Tips

- You can test your function independently by calling it with mock `pars` and coordinate grids.
- Use vectorized NumPy operations for performance.
- Return `float32` arrays if memory efficiency is critical.

---

#### üì¨ Support

For more advanced use cases or to contribute your functions, refer to the [AGN_decompose GitHub repository](https://github.com/hjibarram/AGN_decompose) or contact the maintainer.

---

### Documentation: `priors_prop.yaml`

This YAML file defines the prior configuration for the model parameters used in a photometric decomposition, the package has a predefined model named `moffat`, and its prior configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/hjibarram/AGN_decompose/blob/main/AGNdecomp/configfiles/priors_prop.yml). Each parameter includes a LaTeX-compatible plot label, an initial guess, and lower/upper bounds for the fitting process with the next structure:

```yaml

--- 
models:
  - name: MODEL_NAME 
    parameters:   
      - name: Par1
        name_plot: '$Par_1$'
        ini_value: InitValue  
        inf_value: LoweBound  
        sup_value: UpperBound  

```

---

### üìå Notes

- All parameters are provided with an `ini_value` (initial guess), `inf_value` (minimum allowed), and `sup_value` (maximum allowed).
- The `name_plot` field uses LaTeX syntax to allow rendering of mathematical symbols in plots or graphical output.
- This configuration is likely used in an automated fitting pipeline or modeling framework.

---

#### üîß Example: Model `moffat`

The `moffat` model is commonly used to describe point spread functions (PSFs) in astronomical imaging, this model is predefined within the package, but the user can define his own models with the use of `ext_file`. The parameters listed below are likely used for 2D image fitting or profile modeling.

| Parameter | Plot Label | Description | Initial Value | Lower Bound | Upper Bound |
|-----------|------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| `At`      | `$A_t$`     | Amplitude or normalization factor of the Moffat profile. | 0.22 | 0.1 | 0.5 |
| `alpha`   | `$\alpha$` | Moffat parameter controlling the width of the core. | 2 | 0 | 10 |
| `beta`    | `$\beta$`  | Moffat parameter that controls the wings of the profile. | 2 | 0 | 10 |
| `xo`      | `$X_0$`     | X-coordinate of the profile center. | 0 | -10 | 10 |
| `yo`      | `$Y_0$`     | Y-coordinate of the profile center. | 0 | -10 | 10 |
| `Io`      | `$I_e$`     | Effective intensity, typically at the effective radius. | 0.01 | 0 | 10 |
| `bn`      | `$b_n$`     | Sersic parameter related to profile concentration. | 2 | 0.5 | 20 |
| `Re`      | `$R_e$`     | Effective radius (radius enclosing half of the light). | 4 | 0 | 30 |
| `ns`      | `$n_s$`     | Sersic index defining the shape of the light profile. | 2 | 0 | 15 |
| `ellip`   | `$e_s$`     | Ellipticity of the model (0 = circular). | 0 | 0 | 10 |
| `theta`   | `$\theta_s$` | Position angle of the model in degrees. | 0 | 0 | 180 |
