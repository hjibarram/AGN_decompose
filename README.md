# AGN_decompose v2.1.0.dev ðŸš€

2D AGNâ€‘Host decomposition via bidimensional photometric decomposition.

---

## ðŸ“– Description

AGN_decompose is a Python-based tool designed for the two-dimensional decomposition of integral field spectroscopic (IFU) images of galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN). It uses an iterative method to separate the nuclear AGN emission from the host galaxy, yielding clean spectra and spatial maps of both components ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-pdf/536/1/752/61021285/stae2623.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

This tool is ideal for analyzing astronomical data and studying AGN properties without contamination from the surrounding galaxy.

## ðŸ›  Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hjibarram/AGN_decompose.git
cd AGN_decompose
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the package:

```bash
pip install .
```

Or:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Main Features

- **2D decomposition**: Iteratively separates AGN and host components.
- **IFU-ready**: Designed for integral field spectroscopy data.
- **Modular workflow**: Organized into reusable functions under `AGNdecomp/`.
- **Usage examples**: Step-by-step guides under `Examples/`.

## ðŸš€ Basic Usage

After installation, you can import the module and perform decomposition:

```python
from AGNdecomp import Decomposer

# Initialize with IFU image or datacube
decomp = Decomposer('path/to/image.fits')

# Run decomposition
results = decomp.run()

# Save separated spectra
results.save_spectra('AGN.fits', 'host.fits')

# Plot component maps
results.plot_maps('AGN_map.png', 'host_map.png')
```

See the `Examples/` directory for real use cases (e.g., `decompose_example.py`).
